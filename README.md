## magicdesign

Welcome to `magicdesign` :v: - an R package for creating and testing MAGIC population designs via simulation.  

You will need the `devtools` package to install `magicdesign`. If you already have `devtools`, you can skip to the line of code.  

`install.packages("devtools")`  
`devtools::install_github("cjyang-sruc/magicdesign")`  

There is a high chance that R will ask you to install some package updates. Please ignore those updates because the update installations are buggy with `devtools`. If you really want to install the updates, please do that separately.  

To check if you have successfully installed `magicdesign`, run the following:  

`library(magicdesign)`  

If you wish to use the Shiny app `magicdesignee`, run the following:  

`magicdesignee()`  

Please refer to the following sites for further information including user instructions and FAQs.

Thank you for checking out `magicdesign` and `magicdesignee`. Please [email me](mailto:cyang@sruc.ac.uk) if you have any issue or suggestion.
